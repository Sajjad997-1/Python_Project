# Anti-Money Laundering System.

## Problem

Money laundering is the illegal act of hiding the source of illegally obtained money through complex transactions. Globally, it amounts to 2-5% of GDP, or $800 billion - $2 trillion annually, necessitating advanced monitoring systems. Anti-money laundering (AML) software helps financial institutions monitor transactions daily or in real-time to detect risks. Our solution automates the detection of suspected money laundering cases. 

## Implementation:

1. Identification of the dataset.
2. Cleaning the dataset to remove redundant data.
3. Training the Machine Learning model and building a rule based algorithm.
4. A system created by integrating both the Rule Based System and Machine Learning, will flag the transactions into different categories.
5. Potential fraudulent transactions will be identified.
6. Whole backend will be integrated with a fontend platform.
7. User can upload the data of daily transactions and can get potential fraudulent transactions.
